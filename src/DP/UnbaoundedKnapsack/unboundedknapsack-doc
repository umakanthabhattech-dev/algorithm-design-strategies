unbounded Knapsack Is ?
You are given n items, each with a weight and a value.
You can take an item multiple times.
The goal is to maximize total value without exceeding the knapsack’s capacity

bounded Knapsack Is ?
You are given n items, each with a weight and a value.
Each item has a limited quantity.
The goal is to maximize total value without exceeding the knapsack’s capacity

fractional Knapsack Is ?
You are given n items, each with a weight and a value.
You can take fractions of an item.
The goal is to maximize total value without exceeding the knapsack’s capacity.

| Type                | Key Idea                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 0-1 Knapsack        | Take once or not         |
| Bounded Knapsack    | Take up to k times       |
| Unbounded Knapsack  | Take unlimited times     |
| Fractional Knapsack | Take fractions (Greedy)  |
| Group Knapsack      | Pick one from each group |
| Multi-Dimensional   | More than one constraint |
