1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick
You are given a wooden stick of length n units. The stick is labeled from 0 to n.
You are also given an array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should
perform a cut at. You should perform the cuts in any order you want.
The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut. The total cost
is the sum of costs of all cuts. Return the minimum total cost of making all the cuts.
Example 1:
Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: We can perform the cuts as follows:
- Cut at position 3: cost = 7
- Cut at position 5: cost = 4
- Cut at position 1: cost = 2
- Cut at position 4: cost = 1
Total cost = 7 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 16
Example 2:
Input: n = 9, cuts = [5,6,1,4,2]
Output: 22
Explanation: The optimal order of cuts is [4,2,6,5,1].
The total cost is 22.
Constraints:
2 <= n <= 10^6
